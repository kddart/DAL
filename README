# KDDart Data Access Layer (DAL) project

## KDDart Introduction

The KDDart Knowledge Discovery System provides users with the ability to securely and efficiently integrate three diverse types of data:

* Phenotypic;
* Genetic;
* Environmental.

While KDDart has much of its roots in breeding and agricultural purposes, it has evolved to include multidisciplinary, agro-ecological and environmental research undertakings.

Offering KDDart as an Open Source platform is intended to pave the way for a collaborative environment to develop software applications that address current and future research needs.

## DAL Introduction

DAL is a REST web service data access gateway to KDDart databases.

DAL can be deployed using Ansible deployment script. Documentation for deploying DAL from Ansible to Centos 7 can be found in other/deploy_with_ansible/centos7/README . 

More information about KDDart system can be found at: http://www.kddart.org


## Supported Operating Systems 

Currently DAL can be deployed on CentOS07 and openSUSE 15. However, to prepare for Cent0S7 end of life in June 30 2024, it is recommended that DAL only be installed on openSUSE 15. As of June 2023, plans are underway to support a Debian deployment of DAL.
