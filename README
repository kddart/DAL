# KDDart Data Access Layer (DAL) project

## KDDart Introduction

The KDDart Knowledge Discovery System provides users with the ability to securely and efficiently integrate three diverse types of data:

* Phenotypic;
* Genetic;
* Environmental.

While KDDart has much of its roots in breeding and agricultural purposes, it has evolved to include multidisciplinary, agro-ecological and environmental research undertakings.

Offering KDDart as an Open Source platform is intended to pave the way for a collaborative environment to develop software applications that address current and future research needs.

## DAL Introduction

DAL is a REST web service data access gateway to KDDart databases.

DAL can be deployed using Ansible deployment script. Documentation for deploying DAL from Ansible to Centos 7 can be found in other/deploy_with_ansible/centos7/README .
