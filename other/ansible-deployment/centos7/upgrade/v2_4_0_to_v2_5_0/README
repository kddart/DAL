README file for KDDart upgrade using Ansible on RedHat 7 based distribution
==============================================================================
This document provides a basic explanation on how to run a Ansible playbook script to upgrade KDDart DAL in a RedHat 7 based distribution. It also lists the basic requirements to run the Ansible playbook script. This upgrade script has been tested on Centos 7 and Scientific Linux 7 to upgrade DAL from version 2.4.0 to 2.5.0.

The main Ansible playbook script is kddart_dal_upgrade_v2_4_0_to_v2_5_0_centos7_from_file.yml in this directory.

Basic Requirements
------------------

1. Number of machines: At least two GNU/Linux machines are required.
 - One staging machine; and
 - One target machine.
 The staging machine is where kddart_dal_upgrade_v2_4_0_to_v2_5_0_centos7_from_file.yml is run.
 In the YML, there are lot of Ansible instructions and shell commands.
 When the YML is executed by ansible-playbook command, the instructions and shell commands in this YML will be executed in the target machine(s).

2. Staging machine: Requires Ansible version 2.1 or higher.

3. Target machine: Requires:

   * SSH connectivity in which root user in the staging machine ssh to the root user in target machine with password via ssh authorised keys.

   * HTTP access to the Internet to download the required packages and DAL code from github.com.

4. Operating System on target machine: The target machine requires:

   * CentOS 7 or Scientific Linux 7

   * Already has DAL version 2.4.0 deployed

Step-by-step Instructions
-------------------------

The following instructions will upgrade DAL to version 2.5.0 depending on DAL source tar.gz file:

1. Install CentOS 7 or Scientific Linux 7 on the target machine:

   * Turn on network

   * Specify the root password.

2. Make sure there is network connectivity between the staging machine and the target machine.

3. Install Ansible 2.1 or higher on the staging machine.

4. Generate root SSH public/private key on the staging machine.

5. Copy the root public key on the staging machine to the root user in target machine by using ssh-copy-id command.
For example: ssh-copy-id root@target_machine_ip_address.

6. Test the SSH without password from root user on the staging machine to root user on the target machine.

7. In /etc/ansible/hosts file on the staging machine, define:

[kddartserver]
x.x.x.x

and replace x.x.x.x with the IP address of the target machine

8. Run ansible-playbook kddart_dal_upgrade_v2_4_0_to_v2_5_0_centos7_from_file.yml

9. Login as root to the target machine and execute /root/KDDArT-DAL-v2.4.0/other/run_upgrade_dbs.sh

10. As root on the target machine, run:

    * cd /root/KDDArT-DAL-v2.5.0/other/whitebox_test_cases/TestSuite

    * edit dal_base_url.conf and correct the first line for the current URL of your DAL configuration

    * While in the TestSuite directory, run:
      perl -w kddart_dal_test.pl 2 xml/add_data_no_vcol/test_order_all.txt

11. As root on the target machine, execute /root/KDDArT-DAL-v2.5.0/other/run_upgrade_dbs.sh again

    This will clean up all the generated test data produced in step 10.
