Major:

  * Cookie authentication has been fixed with Apahce2_4::AuthCookie and mod_perl 2.0.9 which is available in openSUSE Leap 42.1 and CentOS 7.

  * Permission fields are added to specimen table and the values of these fields are copied from genotype by DAL when a new specimen is created. When any of the permission fields in the genotype table is updated, all values in all the permission fields in the genotype are replicated to their corresponding fields in the specimen table via SQL after update trigger on genotype table. To help with specimens with multiple genotypes, genotypespecimen table has a new field named InheritanceFlag. This field is used by the trigger script for the permission value replication. This improves the speed of the list specimen with pagination.

However, this information will help isolate performance problems and help future performance optimisation work.

  * New interface to list marker data for specific extract across all datasets in the system with a defined dataset type.

Minor:

  * The performance of add/update specimen interfaces has been improved.

  * The performance of list genotype interface for a specific specimen has been improved.

Version 2.3.1
Date: 18/12/2015

Major:

  * Cookie expiry when logging out is reverted to -1d. In version 2.2.7 and 2.3, when DAL session is logged out, DAL keep the expiry of the cookies the same but set the cookie values to empty strings. Before these versions, the logout will set the cookie expiry to -1d. However, there were some issues with multimedia file download. Once easy solution to the multimedia file download issue at the time was not chnage the cookie expiry setting. However, this change caused a problem for the new KDSen online which relies on the logout setting cookie expiry to -1d. In terms of downloading multimedia files, a proper solution was in place. So both issues should be fixed.

  * Support keyword management, trial unit keyword and specimen keyword.

  * Support sub-plot scoring by having TrialUnitSpecimenId as an optional field in samplemeasurement table.

Minor:

  * import/itemgroup/xml is faster by using SQL bulk record insert.

+ Support BOOLEX((x>0 and x<10) or x eq 'NA').

+ Admin user password is changed to 'kddartadmin'.


Version 2.2.6

Major:

+ Add, update, get and list and import markermap are available.

+ Count group by interface is available.

+ Cookie authetication is upgraded to check and protect files under storage directory which stores marker data and multimedia files.

+ Instance number is based on both TraitId and TrialId. In previous versions of DAL, instance number is like a auto number. From this version onward, instance number is incremented based on the specific trial.

+ GIS/Environment module: 2D layer type is supported.

Minor:

+ New interfaces to list marker in an analysisgroup.

+ Update layer supports changing layertype and geometry type if the layer does not any data yet.

+ Filtering parameter is available for update item.

+ Fix GenotypeSpecimenType perl variable declaration bug (#1735).

+ Fix update trial unit specimen bug (#1434).

+ Apache configuration changes for storage directory.

+ Fix instance number column which does not have data in export KDSmart data.

+ Export samplemeasurement csv can take TrialIdCSV as its additional filtering parameter. If TrialUnitIdCSV is provided as well, the export will only return the intersected records that match both TrialId and TrialUnitId filtering criteria (feature #1511).

+ Fix bug #1481 when the number of trait replicates for all the traits in the selected trial is all zero, DAL will return an error 'No trait selected'.

+ Fix bug #1776 regarding missing field in list layer and get layer interfaces.

Version 2.2.5

Major:

+ DAL HTTP error is changed from 401 to 420 for all errors, except for login required error, group selection required error, group administration required error and the errors in login/_username/_rememberme.

Minor:

+ Enable adding an empty plate without any extract.

+ List/field now returns field descriptions as well.

+ First release of online help for every interface.

+ login/_username/_rememberme is put back in the list of operations.

Version 2.2.4

Major:

+ Online help is available for some operations.

+ update/layer/:id is available.

+ Add SpecimenNote to specimengroupentry affecting list/specimengroup/:nperpage/page/:num, get/specimengroup/:id, add/specimengroup, specimengroup/:specgrpid/add/specimen.

+ Prior to version 2.2.4, add/specimengroup and specimengroup/:specgrpid/add/specimen used to take duplicate SpecimenId. Duplicate checking is in place in DAL v2.2.4.

Minor:

+ Fix download datakapture template link when the trial has no trial unit.

+ list/layer provides lastrecorddate for all the layer attributes which has data.


Version 2.2.3

Major:

+ Fix slowness in list small tables like list/breedingmethod. list/breedingmethod was slow in version 2.2.2 because for every breedingmethod DAL checks if this breeding method is used in specimen table or not. If it is not used, DAL will give a delete link. The fix for all list interface is that DAL checks if the record is used in other tables for the delete link in bulk. This improveslist/breedingmethod from 25 seconds to 400 milliseconds. Bulk checking for delete link and other related database record lookup is introduced in this version.

+ Add the filtering feature to list/sepcimengroup and list/itemgroup. This means that list/specimengroup and list/itemgroup are replaced with list/specimengroup/:nperpage/page/:num and list/itemgroup/:nperpage/page/:num.

+ Introduce list/pedigree/:nperpage/page/:num and list/genpedigree/:nperpage/page/:num.

Minor:

+ Make add/specimengroup to accept the situation when specimen is not provided. This is done by modifying specimengroup.dtd.

Version 2.2.2

Major:

+ Genotype alias has type, status and language fields.
+ Introduction of genotype pedigree in addition to specimen pedigree. Genotype pedigree or gen pedigree is seen as the breeding history (pedigree) while specimen pedigress is seen as selection history.
+ Add/list multimedia files for genotype, specimen and site.
+ Being able to filter on factor columns in organisation, contact, site, trial and project.

Minor:

+ Listing genotype alias supports advanced features including filtering.
+ List genotype ancestor and descendant are available.
+ List specimen ancestor and descendant are available.
+ Add, list and get barcodeconf are available.
+ list/factor returns all fields in the factor table.
+ 'factor/table/:tname/add/vcolumn' becomes 'factortable/:tname/add/vcolumn'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2.1

This is a minor release to enable uploading large marker data files of more than several hundreds megabytes.

Major:

+ Changes in marker module schema in order to store marker data in the csv file
+ Import marker data is now based on a csv file storage system.
+ Export marker data is also based on the csv file storage system.
+ Export marker data supports filtering and field selection. Field selection is controlled by two optional parameters (MarkerMetaFieldList and MarkerDataFieldList).

Minor:

+ Analysisgroup has an interface to list the meta data fields.
+ Due to circular foreign key references between item and trialunitspecimen and other tables and time constraint, the foreign key references are not available in the database schemas embedded with this release.
