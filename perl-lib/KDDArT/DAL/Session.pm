=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store::Session - Session based Store


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use base qw(CGI::Application);
 use CGI::Application::Plugin::Session;
 use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication;

  __PACKAGE__->authen->config(
        STORE => 'Session',
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module uses a session to store authentication information across multiple requests.
It depends on the L<CGI::Application::Plugin::Session> plugin being present.  Actually,
it only requires that there be a 'session' method in the CGI::Application module that
will return a valid CGI::Session object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 fetch

This method accepts a list of parameters and fetches them from the session.

=cut

sub fetch {
    my $self = shift;
    my @params = @_;
    my @items;

    foreach my $param (@params) {

      my $key = &_names_to_keys($param);
      push @items, $self->_session->param($key);
    }

    return @items[0..$#items];
}

=head2 save

This method accepts a hash of parameters and values and saves them into the session.

=cut

sub save {
    my $self = shift;
    my %items = @_;
    my $session = $self->_session;
    while (my ($param, $value) = each %items) {
        my $key = _names_to_keys($param);
        $session->param( $key => $value );
    }

    return 1;
}

=head2 delete

This method accepts a list of parameters and deletes them from the session.

=cut

sub delete {
    my $self = shift;
    my @items = &_names_to_keys(@_);
    $self->_session->clear(\@items);
}

sub clear {

    my $self = shift;
    $self->delete('write_token', 'checksum');
}

#
# Return the session object
#
sub _session {
    return $_[0]->authen->_cgiapp->session;
}

#
# We want all parameters in the session to have a common prefix
#
sub _names_to_keys {
    my @names = @_;
    my @keys = map { uc($_) } @names;
    return @keys[0..$#keys];
}
